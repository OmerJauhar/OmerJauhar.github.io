Currently, it is summer break and was lazy for the first 3-4 weeks, but now we are back on track. I have started with AI/ML. Currently, I am following our university professor Dr Muhammad Nauman's YouTube playlist on machine learning to get started on a topic and, for the further mathematics portion, I am referring to CS229 lectures by Andrew Ng. Whereas on the applied side, I am following an IBM Machine Learning course in coursera and certain academy certifications. Initially I thought that I would write a blog on every topic that I learn, but since I am a little short on time, therefore I am gonna go dark for sometime and, Inshallah, when the semesters start, I will hopefully work on projects and will document it w​ith blogs.

That’s All, Folks
